# Clock In Out Analysis

The focus of this project is analysing the times I clocked in and out at the office. I figured this would be interesting to analyse especially considering that as part of my MSc I would have lectures that would sometimes eat into my usual working hours. That coupled with other commitments that come up in life sounded like it would make for an interesting analysis and that's how this project was born.
